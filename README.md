## Description

In this E-commerce Back end repo, I used sequelize to create a backend and seed the database created by mySQL. Some of the technologies I used were mySql2, sequelize,
dotenv, and express. I included a demo video below to show the process and testing it in Insomnia.

## Install

The user should run "npm i" inside their terminal and it should install the packages listed in the package.json file.
